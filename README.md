# Portal-Game
A 2D version of the physics-based puzzle game Portal and the physics engine it runs on.
Written in C for Caltech's CS 3 final project.

These files consist of the backend code written by the team and me for the class. The frontend was provided 
to us, since the goal of the class was to design and write the backend for a physics engine and game that uses it,
not to develop a full-stack game.
